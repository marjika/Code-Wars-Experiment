# Deploying Codewars Activities

Taking some Codewars activities and expanding them to practice and continue learning the many tools to use in designing and creating web pages.  

### Using code wars ideas to create webpages

Codewars (https://www.codewars.com) is a site designed to help programmers practice their skills and learn new ones through fun and interesting activities. This repository is an ongoing project in which I'm attempting to realize the potential fun of some of the activities that I completed.  It helps me to practice javascript, css, html, canvas, classes, user experience, and other new technologies that I incorporate into the webpages.

##### About this Application

This repository was created and is maintained by me, Marjika Howarth, with ideas from Codewars, and is deployed at "https://marjika.github.io/Code-Wars-Experiment/".
